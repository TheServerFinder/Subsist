## Start Server:
Basically, fork it, and run `java -jar bungee.jar` and `java -jar server.jar` in the corresponding folders, and it will run your very own Eaglercraft 1.12 server!

Use the paper jar instead of the default server jar for 1.12.2

## Customize:
Go into the `web/` folder and click on the [eaglercraft_opts.js](web/eaglercraft_opts.js) file. Everything from default language, to default servers (and names!), to website title and icon, to default server to join on page load; can all be customized in this file.
